# Day33-ISS_OVERHEAD

## This program uses two apis one of which is to send the SMS message to your phone when the ISS is overhead. Then, there is the sunrise-sunset api to check whether the current time. There is a margin of error of -5 and +5 for longitude and latitude just so we are given some space. 
## If you want to host this code online so it may run it every hour, I reccomend checking Zapier to run the code and schedule the execution every hour or so.
